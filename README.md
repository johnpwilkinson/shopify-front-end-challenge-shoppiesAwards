## Architecture of the APP

This app is made with React.js. Feel free to fork / clone the repo and spin up locally. The component library React-Bootstrap is used for styling. There are several packages use for more advanced functionality like animations, social-media sharing, and copy/paste. All of these dependencies should be installed when you install my code-base.
